# \[Design]-Denormalise-User-Metadata

#### Problem Statement:

The two data products CourseMetricsJob and AssessmentMetricsJob depends on the user metadata which are generated on joining different tables from core cassandra and LP cassandra. The logic for joining the table and fetching the informations per user type is complex.

#### Solution 1:

We will be fetching the informations from cassandra table , compute all the required fields in the flink job (user-cache-updater job) and update all the fields to the redis cache.

#### Design for the fields to be fetched:
